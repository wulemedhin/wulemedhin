<p>Think about the different people and things in your life that you help protect. There might be times when you're called upon to protect your family or friends. Sometimes, you need to protect items that are special to you, like your favorite toy. If something bad were to happen to any of these things, you'd step up and protect them. Why? Because they're important to you! The environment and the living things within the environment are also worthy of protection because they play important roles in your life and your world!

How cool is it that we live in a world with so many amazing creatures? There are so many amazing birds, mammals, reptiles, fish - you name it! The existence of lots of different kinds of plants and animals is called biodiversity, and our world is a better place because of it. Now, how sad would it be if those species weren't here anymore? That's what would happen if we don't take action to protect endangered species. Animals are becoming extinct due to illegal hunting, habitat destruction, pollution, and climate changes.

Outside of living things, our environment is in need of protection as well. Pollution is serious and it's affecting everything from the air we breathe to the water we drink. Air, water, and land pollution have very harmful effects on the environment, and by extension, on you, too! If the environment is not treated properly, it ultimately has an effect on your life. Remember, this is your home, too!Think about the different people and things in your life that you help protect. There might be times when you're called upon to protect your family or friends.
